# MIPS-Processor-Stalling-
<p align="justify">The MIPS Processor with Stalling repository is a collection of code and documentation that demonstrates the implementation of a MIPS processor with stalling techniques to solve data hazards. The MIPS processor is a popular architecture used in many embedded systems and microcontrollers. Data hazards occur when there is a dependency between instructions that requires data to be processed in a specific order. Stalling is a technique used to avoid data hazards by inserting bubbles (NOP instructions) into the pipeline, which slows down the execution of instructions to allow for data dependencies to be resolved.</p>

<p align="justify">This repository includes a Verilog implementation of a MIPS processor that uses stalling techniques to solve data hazards. The Verilog implementation has been verified using testbenches and simulations to ensure that it works as expected. Additionally, the repository includes documentation that explains the design and implementation of the MIPS processor, including details on how stalling is used to solve data hazards.</p>

<p align="justify">The MIPS Processor with Stalling repository is a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about the implementation of a MIPS processor and the use of stalling techniques to solve data hazards. The code and documentation provided can be used as a reference for building similar systems or as a starting point for further research and development. The repository is open-source, so anyone can contribute to the codebase or documentation and improve upon the implementation.</p>
